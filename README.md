# linux-utils
This is a small collection of tools I use in my offensive linux machine not only for penetration testing purposes, but also to make my life a bit easier. Feel free to use it, distribute it, do whatever you want to do with it.

No much is in there yet, but it will most certainly fill up over time.

Happy hacking.
